                    Seventeen-year-old Hajime Nagumo is your average, everyday otaku. However, his simple life of 
                    pulling all-nighters and sleeping in school is suddenly turned upside down when he, along with 
                    the rest of his class, is summoned to a fantasy world! While the rest of his class are blessed 
                    with godlike powers and tasked with saving the human race from extinction, Hajime's job, a 
                    Synergist, only has a single transmutation skill. Will he be able to survive in this dangerous 
                    world of monsters and demons with only a glorified blacksmith's level of strength?
