                                <p>The Bell Church is a magnificent Taoist Church that sits between Baguio City and La Trinidad, Benguet. Part 
                                of the reason why the Bell Church might be missed is because it has typically not been offered as a part of the 
                                local tours offered by travel agencies because it sits just a bit outside of the normal routes of things to see 
                                when you are visiting Baguio City.</p>

                                <p>Burnham Park is considered to be one of the most famous parks in the country. It is located in Jose Abad 
                                Santos Drive, Baguio City 2600 Benguet Philippines. It covers a total land area of 32.84 hectares. The park is 
                                named after Daniel Hudson Burnham, an American architect and urban planner. He was also the one who laid the 
                                plans and design for Baguio City. Most of the park’s features were originally from Daniel Burnham’s design but 
                                a few changes and alterations were made to enhance the park’s beauty.</p>

                                <p>Camp John Hay has been a huge part of the history of Baguio City, serving as a military post and a place of 
                                refuge for troops in the 1900’s. And now, it continues to serve as a haven not for troops but for locals 
                                and tourists who want to spend some time off from the daily demands of life. If you want to spend some time 
                                closer to nature and do some exercise, you can hike along the Yellow Trail or the Eco Trail. There is also so 
                                many other intresting things in and around this place.</p>
