        In 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its 
        successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function 
        like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It 
        is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit 
        on the market. The most popular game on the system is "Ordinal Scale" (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG 
        developed exclusively for the Augma. Asuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a
         while, and soon Kirito decides to join them. However, they're about to find out that Ordinal 
         Scale isn't all fun and games.

        Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wrestles with inner demons while contending with monsters of his own creation 
        in this sequel from writer\director Shane Black. The story in Iron Man 3 picks up shortly after the events of 
        The Avengers. Having previously entered another dimension in order to save New York City, Tony remains deeply 
        haunted by the experience. Unable to sleep, he throws himself into his work with such intensity that it begins
         to take a heavy toll on both his mental health and his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Tony
          has only started to appreciate the gravity of his problems when an enigmatic terrorist named the Mandarin 
          (Ben Kingsley) hijacks the airwaves and threatens to bring America to its knees with a painful series of "
          lessons" that even President Ellis (William Sadler) won't be able to ignore. When Tony's former security 
          guard Happy Hogan (Favreau) is badly injured in an explosion caused by one of the Mandarin's agents, the 
          vengeful playboy issues a public threat that results in his home being completely destroyed in a 
          devastating attack, leaving him to face his enemy with only one badly damaged prototype suit. 
          Fortunately, Tony isn't on his own, and with the help of Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and a young boy 
          named Harley (Ty Simpkins), he pieces together the mystery of the Mandarin, whose final "lesson" promises 
          to be the most painful of all.
